This MATLAB code is written as part of the course project for COMP 765 - Advanced Topics (Mobile Robotics)
at McGill University, Canada. It demonstrates the geodesic active contour model using distance regularized
level sets for object tracking in videos.

The code can be run from the main file - "GeodesicActiveContour.m"
After running the main file, it needs, as input, the four vertices of the rectangular neighbourhood around
the object (robot) to be tracked.
